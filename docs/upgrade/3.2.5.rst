3.2.5 release notes

*******************
What's new in 3.2.5
*******************

.. note::

    This release is identical to 3.2.4, but had to be released also as 3.2.4 due
    to a Python wheel packaging issue.

Bug Fixes
=========

* Fix cache settings
* Fix user lookup for view restrictions/page permissions when using raw id field
* Fixed regression when page couldn't be copied if CMS_PERMISSION was False
* Fixes an issue relating to uninstalling a namespaced application
* Adds "Can change page" permission
* Fixes a number of page-tree issues the could lead data corruption under
  certain conditions

    Once all template tags have been reviewed and adjusted where necessary,
    the administrator should set ``CMS_UNESCAPED_RENDER_MODEL_TAGS = False``
    in the project settings. At that point, the project is more secure and
    will be ready for any future upgrades.

DjangoCMS Text CKEditor
=======================

Action required
---------------

CMS 3.2.1 is not compatible with djangocms-text-ckeditor < 2.8.1.
