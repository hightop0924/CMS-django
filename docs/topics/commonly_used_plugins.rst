Some commonly-used plugins
##########################

.. warning::
    In version 3 of the CMS we removed all the plugins from the main repository
    into separate repositories to continue their development there.
    you are upgrading from a previous version. Please refer to
    :ref:`Upgrading from previous versions <upgrade-to-3.0>`


Please note that dozens if not hundreds of different django CMS plugins have been made available
under open-source licences. Some, like the ones on this page, are likely to be of general interest,
while others are highly specialised.

This page only lists those that fall under the responsibility of the django CMS project. Please see
the `Django Packages <https://djangopackages.org/search/?q=django+cms>`_ site for some more, or
just do a web search for the functionality you seek - you'll be surprised at the range of plugins
that has been created.
