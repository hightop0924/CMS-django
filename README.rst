The django CMS Association
**************************

The django CMS Association is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2020 with the goal to drive the success of django CMS, by increasing customer happiness, market share and open-source contributions. We provide infrastructure and guidance for the django CMS project.

The non-profit django CMS Association is dependent on donations to fulfill its purpose. The best way to donate is to become a member of the association and pay membership fees. The funding will be funneled back into core development and community projects.
